This file's presence activates the reflection-indexing profile in mastfrog-parent,
which will cause META-INF/injection/reflective.json to be generated, which can be used
by SubstrateVM for generating a native, ahead-of-time-compiled binary of a Java application.

The index will include all methods, fields and constructors which must be available via
reflection for instantiation by Guice, Jackson or similar.
