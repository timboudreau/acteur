        <p>
            This package contains classes for writing output from streams of various
            sorts <i>scalably</i>, emitting data in small chunks so that a request cannot
            pull very large amounts of data into memory.
        </p><p>
            For each case, an Acteur is provided which expects the stream-type (such as a
            <code>Stream</code> or <code>InputStream</code>) to have been made available
            in the request scope by a preceding <code>Acteur</code>, by calling <code>next(theStream)</code>.
        </p><p>
            The stream handling acteur will take care of batching output until all of the data
            has been written (or the client has closed the connection) and will ensure the stream
            gets closed when the connection does, if not sooner.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Streams</h2>
        <p>
            If you have a <code>Stream</code>, do something like this example, which performs
            a directory listing:
