        <h1>Acteur</h1>
        This is a lightweight web framework that sits on top of
        <a href="http://netty.io">Netty</a>, the asynchronous Java NIO
        server framework.
        <p/>
        Its goal is to solve a specific problem that must be addressed to
        make asynchronous frameworks usable for non-trivial tasks:  That
        most back-end APIs in Java <i>are synchronous</i>.  It's wonderful
        that you can write a non-blocking, asynchronous web server that
        can handle thousands of connections at a time with a single thread.
        But as soon as that server needs to talk to something else - say 
        a database, or even just a file, all of that scalability goes
        away and you have a single-threaded server which is offline until
        its done having a conversation with something else.
        <p/>
        In other words, asynchronous is only useful if <i>the entire
            stack is asynchronous</i>.  One of the wonderful things about
        Java is the amount of libraries available, and most of them
        expect to do blocking I/O.  So you need, at the least, some sort
        of threading model that lets you pretend your blocking back-end
        calls are actually non-blocking.
        <p/>
        The standard way to do asynchronous programming is callbacks.
        That is how you do it in popular frameworks
        such as Node.js.  But that creates its own problem:  Such programs
        usually have deeply nested callback structures which are hard to read
        and harder to reuse;
        and in a language like javascript, it is easy to have bugs by doing
        things like referencing a loop variable from a callback that runs long
        after the loop completed.  The Java equivalent would have you writing
        scads of deeply nested inner classes - which you can do, but that
        tends not to result in readable or maintainable code.
        <p/>
        So we have a few problems to solve:
        <ol>
            <li>People like to think about programming as linear sequences 
                of events, not callbacks</li>
            <li>The closest Java comes to function objects are anonymous 
                inner classes, and they are verbose</li>
            <li>Deeply nested <i>inline</i> callbacks, even if they do 
                something useful, are painful to extract into actually 
                reusable logic</li>
        </ol>

        These can be solved fairly cleanly with a simple observation:
        All of those callbacks consist of synchronous code - you're just carving
        up the handling of a request into small chunks of synchronous code
        which don't necessarily get run in linear fashion.
        <p/>
        <i>So, if you can provide a list of the chunks of logic to run, 
            that <u>feels</u> sequential - as in, you can reason about it the way
            you would about sequential code - whether it actually runs that way or not</i>.
        <p/>
        So, we actually don't want to standardize on anonymous inner classes as
        the programming model;  and we want to provide a way to stick together
        a list of chunks of logic to run.
        <p/>
        Those chunks of logic are called:

        <h2>Acteurs</h2>
        The name comes from <a href="http://apidesign.org">Jaroslav Tulach</a>'s 
        observation that this library is more-or-less the
        Actor pattern, but looks a little strange.  So, an Acteur is 
        an Actor...but slightly foreign :-)
        <p/>
        An Acteur does all of its work either in its constructor, culminating in a 
        call to <code>setState()</code>, or in its override of <code>getState()</code>.
        You bundle together a list of Acteurs in a Page - a Page is really a list
        of Acteurs to run to validate a request and set up a response, and an aggregation
        point for things like response headers and whatever will write response data.
        Acteurs are instantiated by Google Guice - in fact, you assemble a page largely
        by giving it a list of Acteur subclasses;  they will be instantiated as
        needed.
        <p/>
        In particular, each Acteur only plays one role.  Say that the logic involved
        in loading a page involves:
        <ol>
            <li>Check that the URL requested is legal</li>
            <li>Check the request cache header IF_MODIFIED_SINCE, and if present and its condition holds, respond with NOT_MODIFIED</li>
            <li>Authenticate the user</li>
            <li>Find the object expressed by the URL</li>
            <li>Write it into the response</li>
        </ol>
        Each of these is handled by a separate Acteur.
        <p/>
        Now, a trick is needed so each one of these can use the results of the earlier
        one's work.  This is handled transparently by the framework, using Guice scopes.
        <p/>
        The output of an Acteur's work is a State.  A State can include an array
        of <i>context objects</i>.  Under the hood, before the next Acteur is created,
        we re-enter the Scope, adding into it all of the context objects included
        in the previous Acteur's exit state.
        <p/>
        Take, for example, authentication.  This is what <code>AuthenticateBasicActeur</code>
        actually does:
        <pre>
public class AuthenticateBasicActeur extends Acteur {

    @Inject
    AuthenticateBasicActeur(Event event, Authenticator authenticator, @Named("realm") String realm) throws IOException {
        Realm r = Realm.createSimple(realm);
        BasicCredentials credentials = event.getHeader(Headers.AUTHORIZATION);
        if (credentials == null) {
            unauthorized(r);
        } else {
            LoginInfo info = authenticator.authenticate(realm, credentials);
            if (info == null) {
                unauthorized(r);
            } else {
                setState(new ConsumedLockedState(info, r, info.getRole(), info.getUser()));
            }
        }
    }

    private void unauthorized(Realm realm) {
        add(Headers.WWW_AUTHENTICATE, realm);
        setState(new RespondWith(HttpResponseStatus.UNAUTHORIZED));
    }
}
        </pre>
        The next Acteur in the chain can then ask for the <code>User</code> object
        found in the above one's state in its constructor:
        <pre> 
public class FileFinder extends Acteur {
   @Inject
   FileFinder (Event event, User user) throws IOException {
       File f = new File (user.getFolder(), event.getPath().toString());
       if (!f.exists) {
          setState (new RespondWith(HttpResponseStatus.NOT_FOUND));
       } else {
          setState (new ConsumedLockedState(f));
       }
   }
}
        </pre>
        and the next one can start sending chunks of the file back to respond
        to the request - by simply having a constructor that takes <code>File</code>
        as one of its arguments.
