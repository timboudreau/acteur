/**
 * Annotation which can be placed on instances of Application to add bindings in

 * <b>Note:</b> If you are using the &#064;HttpCall annotation, you can specify
 * these classes there.
 *
 * @deprecated - With Acteur 1.5 and ServerBuilder, you are not subclassing
 * application anymore, so this class is less useful as it can only appear on
 * the application class. Instead, use {@link HttpCall} with the
 * <code>scopeTypes</code> parameter register types on the acteurs that use
 * them; or use ServerBuilder.withType().
