/**
 * Base class for Acteurs. Implementations should implement ResponseFactory and
 * not expose generic types directly.
 * <p>
 * An acteur is a function object which uses its constructor to do whatever work
 * it is going to do. The output of the constructor is its {@link State}.
 * <p>
 * An acteur also has a response object, which it may alter. Acteurs in a chain
 * each have their own response object (for thread-safety purposes); these are
 * coalesced into a final result.
 * <p>
 * Acteurs may provide objects to subsequent acteurs in a chain by including
 * them in the state's context.
 * <p>
 * Types which are passed between Acteurs need to be registered with the Guice
 * binder and the {@link com.mastfrog.guicy.scope.ReentrantScope} used by the
 * {@link ChainRunner}.
