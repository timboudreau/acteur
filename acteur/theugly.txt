Bits of history that could be discarded:

 - Odd that decororateResponse, create404response take a Netty HttpResponse,
rather than an acteur Response - just an artifact of the early days

 - Etag and LastModified checking annotations only work if you set the
header on the page - should create a communication path for the partially
built responses before they are coalesced - right now each acteur only
sees its own empty response

 - Page.getResponseHeaders() is duplicative and violates the DRY principle,
but needed until the above is fixed

 - Can no longer inject an HttpEvent into a page constructor because it is
not in-scope during page instantiation.  Easy fix in acteur-base, but would
prefer to make Page less necessary rather than encourage subclassing it

 - HackHttpHeaders is problematic - Netty 3 allowed for sending raw ByteBufs
down the pipe;  Netty 4 requires chunked encoding for incremental responses.
Hacking this support back in meant some fussing with Netty's HTTP codec.
This means we go to war with Netty's HTTP codec which wants to set incorrect
values for transfer-encoding;  and sending ByteBufs wreaks havoc with the
HttpContentCompressor, and forces us to have a fork of HttpObjectAggregator.
Supposedly this will improve in a threatened rewrite of Netty's HTTP codec,
so support is still there - but that hasn't happened yet.
